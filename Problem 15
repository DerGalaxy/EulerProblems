Starting in the top left corner of a 2Ã—2 grid, and only being able to move to 
the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a 20Ã—20 grid?
"""
n = 20 #represents a (n-1)x(n-1) grid

#could make a tree in the shape of a square grid from the top left corner
#to the bottom right by diagonal, then evaluate the number of paths
#BUT I won't do that, I will do it more mathematically elegant. 

paths = [1] #list of number of paths for nxn grids, indexed by n
for i in range(1,n):
    temp = paths
    temp.append(2*sum(paths))
    for j in range(1,len(paths)-1):
        temp[j] = temp[j-1]+paths[j]
    paths = temp
    
print paths
print 2*sum(paths)
